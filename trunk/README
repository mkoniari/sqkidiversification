SQKIFRM is a framework to promote diversity using different methods.

Technical Details:

baseline need to be at the same cutt off in the code.

To compile the code :

You have first get in to HPC nodes then try to compile that

How to get in HPC node : qsub -l nodes=1,walltime=1:00:00 -I
How to compile : ./compile

To run the program :
./run.sh topic result lambda


issues :

Fixed:
- different lambda effect on MMR is fixed

TODO :

due to negative and unnormalized initial retrieval score lamda is not working properly. what i did is I calculate the cosine similarity score as
similarity score and disimilarity score.
